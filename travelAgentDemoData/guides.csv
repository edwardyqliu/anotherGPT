Tokyo Default Guide,"Akihabra
Akihabra, aka Akiba, aka electric town is still the destination for toys, games, and electronics. You'll be greeted by shops and flashing lights the moment you step out of the train station.
Notable stops
Ramen: Kyushu Jangara
Toy shop: Kotobukiya

Asakusa
Asakusa is the home of Sensoji, the oldest temple in Tokyo. Highly recommend visiting this area and getting your fortune from the fortune sticks Also, the entrance of Sensoji and the surrounding shopping arcades have a lot of food stalls and souvenir shops. Some things to try are senbei and dangos.
Asakusa is also a much older area and has some of the old Japan feels.
Notable stops
Our Our Running station - cafe where you can rent a locker, go for a run along the Sumida River, and then come back and take shower all in same shop
Sample of restaurants to visit are covered by this youtube video

Ginza
This is where rich people shop and also the home of all the brand stores. But I do recommend visiting Mitsukoshi Shopping Mall for the food and dessert stores in their basement floors. The bottom floors of all shopping malls are where a variety of savory and sweet things can be found but Japan snacks are next level and Mitsukoshi has all the best foods.
Notable stops
Stationary: Ito-ya

Harajuku/Omoetesando
I usually tell people to visit B Side Label since it's a good place to find high quality stickers that are great souvenirs that aren't tacky. It's a good homing location to explore the Harajuku and Omoetesando area without hopefully getting stuck going down Takeshita street - it's where all the teens and tourist hang out. But if you do get stuck in Takeshita Street, the thing to do is to eat crepe - especially from Marion Crepe. There's also a McDonalds nearby and I only mention McDonalds since they have unique dishes that's only in Japan that rotates often.
This area is also where the Meiji Temple is located - highly recommend entering this temple area as it is an experience. Also recommend visiting Empress's Garden inside Meiji Temple.
If possible, I recommend visiting this area on Sunday - it's extra busy but you can visit Yoyogi Park which is right next to Meiji Temple and see how Tokyo spends its weekend. There's also a lot of street performances in the park and you may catch the Rockability group that hangout by the entrance of Yoyogi park
Notable stops
The Real McCoy's
Snow Peak
Tokyo Tarako Spaghetti

Ikebukuro
Visit Sunshine City to see the biggest Pokemon Store but warning the other side of the Ikebukuro train station is the red light district so make sure to follow the signs for Sunshine City
Notable stops
Pokemon Center Mega Tokyo
Pikachu Sweets Cafe
Capcom Cafe - lots of gashapon and also has an arcade

Shinjuku
Shinjuku is both a city and ward - basically to say this area is huge.
I recommend visiting Ben Fiddich. It's an amazing cocktail bar and the staff and owner (and also the main bartender) all speak English. They're rank as one of the top 25 cocktail bar in the world but what makes Ben Fiddich unique is that the owner also owns a farm where he develops all his liquors and grows his own ingredients. I also recommend getting a shot of the 1916 Spanish Chartreuse
Notable stops
Ramen: Fuunji
Nakajima - cheapest Michellin star restaurant

Shibuya
Also known as the place to go to shop. This is the home of Hachiko, the often used in movies Shibuya Scramble (it's right in front of Hachiko's statue), and the iconic 109 shopping mall. Beware, the Shibuya train station is its own city and it's very easy to get lost inside. Sometimes it's better to just exit and find what you're looking from the outside in. It's the same with the Tokyo Station.
Shibuya gets really busy but unfortunately there's a lot of good food places here:
Notable stops
Tokyo Milk Cheese Factory
Nintendo Store - in Shibuya PARCO

Shimokitazawa
For music lovers and vintage, used clothing
Notable stops
Shelter - music venue referenced in Bocchi the Rock!

Marunouchi/Tokyo Station
Another train station that's really easy to get lost in but has a lot of restaurants and best of all dedicated snack stores - Japan cookies and candies are next level. Nearby is the Imperial Palace - there's limited tours inside but there's also a running path that goes around the palace grounds
Notable stops
Stationary: Traveler's Company
Tonkatsu Suzuki
Tora-ya - traditional dessert store + tea

Ueno
There's a park here and a shrine in the middle of the lake. Has an Andersen bakery in the train station

Tokyo Shopping Guide,"From cutting edge electronics to colorful anime goods, traditional crafts, trendy fashion and branded goods, Tokyo has a shop for practically anything one could ever want to buy - although not necessarily in your desired price range.

Tokyo's varied sightseeing districts double as shopping districts, many of them with their own character and specialties. The following is a general rundown of what to expect on the shopping scene of each district so you can familiarize and prepare yourself for a shopping spree in the big city.


Shibuya
Shinjuku - One of Tokyo's largest shopping and entertainment districts
Centered around Shinjuku Station, a major transportation hub and the busiest train station in the world, this district is home to half a dozen major department stores, including several flagship stores; as well as outlets of Japan's largest electronics retailers combined with a host of other shops and boutiques along its streets and underground shopping arcades.

Shibuya - Center of youth fashion
Shibuya is another large shopping district that is the birthplace of many of Japan's youth fashion trends. It is home to some well known, trend setting clothing stores such as Shibuya 109, as well as dozens of small fashion stores along its streets. Small boutiques, including high fashion and designer brands, continue to be found through to Aoyama and Daikanyama where the atmosphere is more subdued compared to the electric brightness of Shibuya.


Takeshita Dori in Harajuku
Harajuku - High fashion vs youth trends and counter culture
Harajuku has a split personality with two parallel shopping streets that cater to very different shoppers. Omotesando, known as Tokyo's Champs-Elysees, is a tree-lined avenue with upscale boutiques, cafes and several leading designer brand shops. Takeshita Dori, on the other hand, is a center of youth fashion and counter culture found along a narrow street crammed with shops and cafes targeting the younger, teenage crowd.

Ginza - Tokyo's premier upmarket shopping district
Ginza features high-end department stores, boutiques and designer brand stores. Nearly every leading Japanese and international fashion brand has a presence here, as well as major electronics brands such as Sony and Apple. The shopping extends into the nearby Yurakucho area with more department stores, boutiques and electronic retailers.


Ginza
Nihonbashi - Historic merchant district featuring traditional goods and local foods
The Nihonbashi district served the capital as one of the leading centers of trade and commerce during the Edo Period. It is the site of the flagship branch of Mitsukoshi, Japan's first department store and many smaller shops with centuries-long histories. Thanks to tasteful, recent redevelopment that built on the district's history, Nihonbashi will delight shoppers with an interest in traditional products and regional foods.

Marunouchi - Upscale shopping next to Tokyo Station
The Marunouchi district on the west side of Tokyo Station is a business district where many of largest companies have their headquarters. The lower floors of many of the office buildings along the central Nakadori avenue contain cafes, restaurants and an abundance of shops. Additional department stores and an underground mall can be found at nearby Tokyo Station.

Ikebukuro - Large department stores and electronics chains
Ikebukuro is another large shopping district centered around Ikebukuro Station, one of Japan's busiest train stations. Ikebukuro is a battleground between large department store groups including Sunshine City, Tokyo's first city within a city. Ikebukuro also competes with Akihabara as an electronics center with the presence of big electronics retailers.


Nihonbashi
Odaiba - Shopping malls on a man-made island
Odaiba is a popular shopping and entertainment district built on a man-made island in Tokyo Bay. The island is a trendy date spot, and its Aquacity, Decks and Diver City shopping malls cater to this crowd by mixing shopping with entertainment.

Tokyo Solamachi - Shopping at the base of the Tokyo Skytree
Opened in 2012 at the base of the Tokyo Skytree, the Tokyo Solamachi is an exciting shopping and entertainment complex with over 300 shops and restaurants, including shops related to local Tokyo specialties and many unique souvenir shops.


Tokyo Solamachi
Roppongi - Upscale shopping in the middle of the city
The Roppongi district had a facelift with the opening of the Roppongi Hills and Tokyo Midtown complexes which brought in hundreds of new upscale shopping and dining choices. Most shops specialize in fashion, accessories, household goods and interior design.

Sugamo - The Old Ladies' Harajuku
The shops along Sugamo's popular 800 meter long Jizo Dori shopping street cater to an elderly clientele. The street is named after a beloved statue of the Jizo Bodhisattva that stands on the grounds of the local temple and is believed to have healing powers. The district is particularly lively on the 4th, 14th and 24th of every month when the temple holds a small festival.


Akihabara
In addition to the major shopping districts that carry a little of everything, Tokyo has several specialized shopping districts that focus on just one type of product such as electronics, books or Buddhist altars:

Akihabara - Electronics mecca and center of Otaku culture
Akihabara is home to many electronics retailers such as Yodobashi Camera, Yamada Denki, Laox and Sofmap as well as hundreds of small discount electronics shops that are jammed along the district's streets and back alleys. Akihabara is also the center of Japan's burgeoning otaku culture with dozens of shops devoted to anime, manga, collectibles and games.

Kappabashi - Restaurant supply and everything related to cooking (except food)
Kappabashi is a specialty district that caters to restaurants. Found around Tawaramachi Station on the Ginza Subway line, not far from Asakusa, the district's shops sell everything a restaurant needs (except for fresh food) including cookware, ceramic, earthenware, knives, furniture, and even the plastic and wax food samples found in restaurant displays.

Other specialized shopping districts found around Tokyo include Jimbocho, located north of the Imperial Palace, which is known for a high concentration of book publishers and book stores; and Ochanomizu (one stop from Akihabara Station on the JR Sobu Line) which is a haven for shoppers looking for musical instruments and sports equipment.


Kappabashi
Popular souvenir items such as yukata, kokeshi dolls and woodblock prints may be difficult to find in shopping areas geared toward Japanese shoppers, although large department stores usually carry a variety of traditional Japanese goods, typically at high quality and price levels.

More variety and lower prices are offered by souvenir shops found in districts popular among foreign tourists, such as Asakusa, Akihabara and the Tokyo Skytree. Nakamise Dori, the shopping street along the approach to Sensoji Temple in Asakusa offers a particularly wide selection of souvenirs. Another favorite among tourists is the Oriental Bazaar in Harajuku.

Finally, 100 yen shops sell lots of everyday items that make popular souvenirs such as chopsticks, sake cups, stationery, home decorations and other items, at an affordable 100 yen per item (plus consumption tax). 100 yen shops can be found all over Tokyo.


Nakamise Dori in Asakusa
Those interested in food markets should head to the Tsukiji Outer Market which continues to sell fresh seafood and produce in the lively stalls that pack the district's narrow lanes despite the fact that the adjacent wholesale market closed in 2018.

Flea markets specializing in second hand goods are also held throughout Tokyo at some temples, shrines and other public venues. They are usually held on Sundays, either every week or every other week, and usually have vendors selling second hand goods such as clothes, tools and antiques.


Tsukiji Outer Market

Tokyo Museum Guide,"Tokyo has dozens if not hundreds of museums, spanning nearly every topic and interest, which fall into the following categories:

Art and photography
History and science
Zoos and aquariums
Transportation and commerce
Anime and others
Museum fans with limited time should consider a visit to Ueno Park where a variety of first class museums are concentrated closely together, including the impressive Tokyo National Museum, the National Museum of Western Art, the Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum, the National Science Museum and Ueno Zoo along with some smaller museums.


Museums in Tokyo are typically closed on one day of the week (usually Monday) and during the New Year holidays (typically December 29 to January 4). If the regular weekly closing day falls on a national holiday, most museums will open on the holiday and close the next day instead.

Some museums have extended hours on certain days (typically Fridays), and some offer free entrance to selected exhibitions or on certain days of the month. Most museums allow entry until 30 minutes prior to closing time.

Those planning to visit multiple museums should consider using the Grutto Pass. For 2500 yen, this pass provides entrance or discounted entrance to around 100 museums, zoos and aquariums in the Tokyo area. It is sold annually from April 1 to January 31 and is valid for one entry to each participating museum. The pass expires two months from its first use or on March 31, whichever occurs first. The pass can be purchased at participating museums."

Tokyo Observation Deck Guide,"Since the late 1950s, skyscrapers and towers have sprung up across Tokyo.

Observation decks are not the only way to enjoy views of the city from high up in the air. Several skyscrapers house restaurants on their top floors from where diners can simultaneously enjoy good food and good views of the city. Top floor restaurants are an especially good way of seeing the city views at night after other observation decks close. Some notable districts where top floor restaurants are common include Marunouchi, Shiodome, Shinjuku and Shibuya.

Furthermore, many of Tokyo's high level hotels are also located on the top floors of skyscrapers, allowing them to give their guests exclusive views of the city. Some of these include the Park Hyatt, Ritz Carlton, Mandarin Oriental, Park Hotel Tokyo and Shangri La.

Tokyo Beach Guide,"Tokyo offers a few beaches along its coast, but the water quality in the city is rather low, although it has been improving steadily over recent decades. Many more beaches are located within a 1-2 hour train ride in nearby Chiba and Kanagawa prefectures and on the Izu Peninsula.

The beaches around Tokyo allow for sunbathing and swimming, and many are also good for surfing and windsurfing. Unlike the beaches in Okinawa, most beaches around Tokyo are not ideal for snorkeling and diving except for a few on the Izu Peninsula.


Surfers catching a break
The official swimming season at beaches around Tokyo is typically from mid July through August, during which time lifeguards are on duty.

Some beaches near urban areas prohibit alcohol consumption, exposed tattoos and noise.


Central Tokyo
There are a handful of sand beaches in the city where people can enjoy sunbathing.

Inside a yakitori restaurant in Shinjuku
Tokyo is one of the world's most exciting dining destinations. The city features a wide range of both local and regional Japanese cuisine in addition to all types of international fare. Its top restaurants have accrued more Michelin stars than both Paris and New York combined. But good food can be found at every price range from cheap hole-in-the-wall joints to expensive high-class restaurants with every budget in between.

Tokyo specialties
As Japan's political center for over four centuries, Tokyo has naturally exerted great influence on Japanese cuisine. Consequently, some Tokyo specialties have become so popular that they are now known as the standard version of the dish rather than a local specialty. Local creations from Tokyo (formerly called Edo) are often referred to as ""Edo-mae"", literally meaning ""in front of Edo"", in reference to Edo Bay (now Tokyo Bay) which provided the city with its local seafood. The following are some popular Tokyo specialties:


Nigiri-zushi
The most popular type of sushi today, nigiri-zushi originated as a fast-food dish in Tokyo. Consisting of a piece of seafood put onto a small ball of rice, it takes much less time and effort to prepare than more traditional sushi dishes. Nigiri-zushi are served at all sushi restaurants from inexpensive conveyor belt sushi to Michelin-starred restaurants. The Tsukiji Outer Market is one of the best places to eat fresh sushi.

Tempura
Another of Japan's most famous dishes, tempura also underwent major development in the capital city. Before the Edo Period, mainly vegetables were used for tempura, but Edo cooks started to deep fry seafood from Edo Bay in tempura batter, resulting in the more varied dish we know today. A visit to a specialized tempura restaurant (tempura-ya) is the recommended way to enjoy tempura.

Soba
Soba noodles (buckwheat noodles) are a popular dish in many regions of Japan. In Tokyo, they were particularly popular during the Edo Period, and can be found all across the city today, including at standing soba eateries and establishments specialized in soba (soba-ya). The dipping sauce used in Tokyo is traditionally relatively thick, and diners are encouraged to dip their noodles into it only lightly.

Chankonabe
Chankonabe is a hot pot dish that serves as the diet of sumo wrestlers. It is a healthy, protein-rich dish that contains mainly fish or chicken and seasonal vegetables. The best place to try chankonabe is at one of the specialty restaurants around the Kokugikan Sumo Stadium in Ryogoku, many of which are run by ex-sumo wrestlers.

Monjayaki
Monjayaki is a type of runny pancake made of flour and water mixed with ingredients like sliced cabbage and small pieces of seafood and meat, which are then cooked on a hot grill. A small spatula is used to scrape some of the cooked monjayaki and eat it off the grill. The ""Monjayaki Street"" in Tsukishima is the best place to eat the dish.

Tsukudani
Tsukudani are small pieces of food that were simmered in a mixture of soy sauce and sweet sake to preserve them. They are commonly enjoyed as an accompaniment to a bowl of cooked rice. Tsukudani has its roots on Tsukudajima Island near Tsukishima where Tokugawa Ieyasu relocated fishermen skilled in making tsukudani.

Tokyo Sweets
Tokyo is home to various types of traditional Japanese sweets (wagashi). These include ningyoyaki, small red bean paste filled cakes shaped like dolls or other forms; dorayaki, a pastry made of sweet pancakes with a layer of red bean paste sandwiched in between; and anmitsu, a dessert typically consisting of agar jelly, a scoop of red bean paste, small mochi balls and seasonal fruits topped with sweet black sugar syrup.
Regional specialties from across Japan
Tokyo is also a good place to enjoy regional Japanese foods from across the country, which have been available in Tokyo since the Edo Period when the regional lords (daimyo) from across Japan were forced to maintain large villas in the capital and spend alternate years there. A by-product of this policy to keep the regional lords under the shogun's control was the influx of various regional cooking styles into the capital.

These days, foods from across the country can be found at many restaurants specialized in regional cuisines. Some of the most popular regional foods that can be sampled around Tokyo come from Okinawa, Kagoshima, Fukuoka, Kyoto and Hokkaido. In addition, successful restaurants from across Japan often open outlets in Tokyo in an effort to branch out and make a name for themselves.

International dining
International food is enjoying great popularity in Tokyo, and many Japanese chefs have achieved recognition for their skills in foreign cooking, often acquired by practical training overseas. Furthermore, Tokyo is home to various international communities, which have brought a variety of different cuisines with them.

While popular foods such as Chinese, Indian, Italian, French and Korean can be found virtually anywhere in the city, there are also a few districts serving less prominent international cuisines especially around the embassies located in the Azabu, Hiroo and Roppongi districts. Below are a few of the more concentrated international districts:


Shin Okubo - Koreatown
Shin Okubo, popularly known as Tokyo's Koreatown, is home to a large number of Korean residents. Consequently, many Korean shops and restaurants are found along the main road and side streets around Shin-Okubo Station, one stop north of Shinjuku Station.

Kagurazaka - France Town
Kagurazaka has a significant French presence due to a French school and a French-Japanese culture center nearby. A large variety of French cafes and restaurants can be found throughout the district alongside a host of trendy and upscale, modern and traditional Japanese restaurants.

Ikebukuro - Chinatown
Ikebukuro is one of Tokyo's major city centers along the Yamanote Line. The area north of the station has become a little bit of a modern Chinatown with a variety of Chinese restaurants, but without the iconic entrance gates, Chinese temples or density of Chinese restaurants found in the more historic Chinatowns of Japan.
Casual dining
There are lots and lots of casual dining restaurants of all types found across Tokyo. While restaurants are easy to find just about anywhere in the city, good places to go for a large variety of them are around train stations, entertainment districts and the restaurant floors of most department stores, where there is usually a good selection of restaurants ranging from Japanese cuisine to international dining.

Izakaya are the most common type of casual dining establishments and are good places to try a variety of dishes. They can be found in droves around train stations and entertainment districts and serve popular food items such as yakitori, sashimi and of course beer. The following are a few casual dining areas around Tokyo that are well known for their atmosphere:


Shinjuku
On the northwest side of Shinjuku Station is Omoide Yokocho, a small network of alleyways colloquially known as Piss Alley. The narrow lanes are filled with dozens of tiny eateries serving mostly yakitori, but also ramen, soba or kushiyaki. Many of the restaurants consist of just a small counter and can seat less than a dozen diners, while larger ones may have a couple of tables or a second floor.

Yurakucho
A lively restaurant district can be found nestled beneath the train tracks around Yurakucho Station. The area is typically known as ""Yurakucho Gado Shita"" (lit. below the guardrail), or sometimes as ""Yakitori Street"" due to the numerous yakitori restaurants in the area, but izakaya and casual international pubs are also popular. Diners can enjoy their meals surrounded by the chatter of other customers mixed in with the sound of trains passing overhead.

Asakusa
West of the Sensoji Temple in Asakusa is a 70-80 meter long street lined with izakaya that exude a nostalgic charm. Nicknamed ""Hoppy Street"" after a popular alcoholic drink sold in the area, the restaurants that line the road specialize in beef tendon stew and other sharable dishes that go well with drinks.
Fine dining
Tokyo is well known for its fine dining and has the highest number of Michelin-starred restaurants of any city in the world. Fine dining restaurants are often found on the top floors of skyscrapers and major hotels, and the cuisine served at these restaurants ranges from traditional Japanese to international and fusion fare. Of course, they tend to be priced accordingly, and some restaurants may require advance reservations. The following are a few districts that are known for their fine dining establishments.


Tokyo Station
There are several skyscrapers on the Marunouchi side of Tokyo Station, such as the Marunouchi Building, which offers a variety of nice restaurants on its top two floors with views out over the city. There are also several fine restaurants at the district's leading hotels, such as the Tokyo Station Hotel, the Peninsula and the Shangri-La.

Shiodome
Shiodome is a recently redeveloped modern city district with elevated walkways, skyscrapers and hotels. Some of the nicer places to dine with views over the city include the Caretta Shiodome, Shiodome City Center and Conrad Hotel.

Shinjuku
With numerous department stores and large hotels, Shinjuku offers a plethora of choices to travelers when it comes to dining. Restaurants in the skyscraper district west of Shinjuku Station as well as in the luxury hotels offer fine dining options in addition to the many casual dining options in the area.

Ginza
Ginza is Tokyo's most famous upmarket shopping and dining district, and is also home to some of the most expensive real estate in Japan. While there are not many skyscrapers, fine dining restaurants can be found in department stores and in buildings off the main streets.

Azabu
The Azabu area between Roppongi and Hiroo is home to many embassies and consulates. As a result, it offers a lot of international restaurants, including several Michelin starred establishments.
Themed dining
Themed cafes such as maid and butler cafes, as well as pet cafes are popular attractions where you can converse or play games with a maid or butler, or spend time with animals such as cats, rabbits or birds while eating light meals or enjoying a coffee or tea. Maid cafes can easily be found in Akihabara whereas butler cafes are more concentrated around Ikebukuro. Pet cafes can be found in small numbers around the city. All these types of cafes usually charge a small cover charge in addition to food and drinks.

Another type of themed dining are food theme parks which typically feature different variations of a specific food such as ramen or gyoza. Despite the name, food theme parks are usually indoors and work similarly to a food court except that all the vendors are selling variations and regional types of the same dish. Some food theme parks around Tokyo include the Namja Gyoza Stadium in Ikebukuro and a ramen theme park in Aquacity on Odaiba.

Finally, for those looking for a quirky and entertaining meal, themed restaurants like the Ninja Restaurant and The Lock Up in Tokyo can be a fun and appealing attraction. Themed restaurants are decorated similarly to an amusement park, have themed menus and staff who dress in costume. The food usually follows the overall theme of the restaurant, and there may be some type of show during the meal.


Namja Gyoza Stadium in Ikebukuro
Japanese-style breakfast
The easiest place to try a Japanese-style breakfast are hotels, many of which offer Japanese breakfast set meals or buffets with both Japanese and Western dishes. Otherwise a Japanese-style breakfast is difficult to find as most restaurants and coffee shops tend to serve Western-style breakfasts or coffee and toast sets only. One option may be gyudon restaurants which often offer basic Japanese breakfast sets at cheap prices.

For the more adventurous, the sushi restaurants in the Tsukiji Outer Market and at Toyosu Market are open from early morning, offering fresh sushi for breakfast. Note that many of these restaurants close by mid-afternoon.
